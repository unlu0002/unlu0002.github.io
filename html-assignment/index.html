            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>Since I was 12 years old, I had a passion to be a <em>designer</em>. Back then, I used to draw pictures of different things and build and create new objects from other things. Until today, I built and improved myself on design and I am eager to learn more about anything related to design. I will always remember the day when I took the 2<sup>nd</sup> place on a design competition of <abbr title="Istanbul Metals And Minerals Exporters’ Association">IMMEA</abbr>.</p>

            <p>I am eager to learn how to create for digital realms. It does not matter how technical or how aesthetic it is. I just want to get to know the right tools to create more, so that I can build functional, useful, and beautiful products and services for the people.This is what I want the most.</p>

            <blockquote>“Good design is as little as possible. Less, but better, because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.”</blockquote>
